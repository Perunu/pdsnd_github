### Project Title
Exploring Bike Share Data

### Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, will be used to uncover bike share usage patterns between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
- The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
-- Gender
-- Birth Year

#### This project explores the following information:

_#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)_
- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

_#2 Popular stations and trip_
- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

_#3 Trip duration_
- total travel time
- average travel time

_#4 User info_
- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used
